## Features

- Proxy Support to avoid rate limits
- Easy Configuration

## Requirements

- Node.js v18+ LTS [Download](https://nodejs.org/dist/v18.20.6/node-v18.20.6-x64.msi)
- GokiteAI wallet addresses
- Proxy (Optional). Recommended: [Cherry Proxy](https://center.cherryproxy.com/Login/Register?invite=029ad2d3)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/dynli6916/gokiteai2-bot.git
   cd gokiteai2-bot
   ```

2. Install Dependencies:

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `proxy.txt` file in the root directory and add your proxies (one per line) (Optional).

   ```
   http://user:pass@host:port
   http://user:pass@host:port
   http://user:pass@host:port
   ```

4. Create an `accounts.txt` file and add your GokiteAI wallet addresses (one per line):

   ```
   0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678
   0xabcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12
   0x9876543210abcdef9876543210abcdef98765432
   ```

## How It Works

The bot automatically:

1. Logs into GokiteAI using your wallet addresses
2. Chats with three different AI agents:
   - **Professor** - Asks educational questions about blockchain technology
   - **Crypto Buddy** - Asks about cryptocurrency market information
   - **Sherlock** - Asks about blockchain transaction analysis
3. Submits receipts for each interaction to earn XP points
4. Tracks your points accumulation

## Usage

1. Run the bot:

```sh
node .
```

2. The bot will automatically:

   - Process each address in accounts.txt
   - Use proxies if available
   - Log in to each account
   - Chat with all three AI agents
   - Submit receipts for each interaction
   - Display earned XP points

3. Monitor the console for real-time progress updates including chat previews

## Configuration Options

- **src/main/gokiteV2bot.js** - Modify agent prompts and behavior

## Troubleshooting

- **Authentication Issues**: If you encounter login problems, make sure your wallet addresses are correct
- **Rate Limiting**: If you see rate limit errors, try using proxies or increasing the delay between requests
- **Response Parsing Errors**: These usually resolve on retry; the bot has built-in retry mechanisms
